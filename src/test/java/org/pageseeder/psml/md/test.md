Let's start with a **single** paragraph.

This paragraph includes a piece of `code`.

Let's have a long paragraph that *continues* on the next line and see if see works
properly 

This is a list:
 * First item
 * Second item
   (also part of the second item?)
 * Third item

### A heading level 3


Now we have a numbered list:
 2. First item
 3. Second item
   (also part of the second item?)
 4. Third item
